# What is tinydrone?

Not your average drone flight system.

tinydrone is an 8 layer neural network, the model was trained to detect collision events and provide predicted steering angles. 

The core model can be found in `autopilot/`

We are working on building custom hardware for tinydrone because the model is intended to be used on Edge devices.
